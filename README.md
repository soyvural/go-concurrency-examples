# Go Concurrency Training Repository

This repository is dedicated to providing training materials and examples for understanding and using concurrency in Go. It covers a wide range of topics related to Go's powerful concurrency model, including goroutines, channels, select, and mutexes.

## Contents

1. [Mutex](./mutex_examples): This package provides examples of using mutexes for synchronizing access to shared resources. It covers both readers and writers, as well as common patterns like mutual exclusion.

2. [Channels](./channel_examples): This package provides examples of using channels for communication between goroutines. It covers both unbuffered and buffered channels.

3. [Select](./select_examples): This package provides examples of using select statements to control concurrent execution. It covers both the basic syntax and some common patterns.
   
4. [Context](./context_examples): This package provides examples of using context.
